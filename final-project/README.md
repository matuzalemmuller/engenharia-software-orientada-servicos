## Description

Final project for _Service-Oriented Software Engineering_ class. This project implements the checkout flow of a web store called NewTec using [Mule ESB](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/esb/what-mule-esb).

The folder `services` contain some of the local services required to run the program, but the code available on this repository is not functional as it requires external web services to be accessed and return the correct values.

The assignment guidelines (in Portuguese) can be found on [Assignment.pdf](Assignment.pdf).

### Databases

The MySQL queries to create the databases used in the project is avaliable on [DBs.md](DBs.md).
